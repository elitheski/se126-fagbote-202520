#Program Promt:
'''Store the file data into 1D parallel lists, then use the appropriate searching algorithms for the menu system options.
Your program should give your user the following menu:
Personal Library Menu
1. Show All Titles – list all book data to the user alphabetically by title
2. Search by Title – allow for an entire title or a title key word
3. Search by Author – show all titles of the searched-for author
4. Search by Genre - show all titles of the searched-for genre
5. Search by Library Number – only allow for one specific library number item
6. Show All Available – show all titles with status “available”
7. Show All On Loan - show all titles with status “on loan”
8. EXIT
When your user runs any of the options 1 – 7, show all data associated with the search [Library Number, Title, Author,
Genre, Page count, Status]. Do not allow the program to end unless the user chooses option 8 to exit. All searches
should not be case sensitive.
